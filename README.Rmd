# regexcite

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A small toy package created for expository purposes, from the second edition of [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org). It is not meant to actually be useful. If you want a package for factor handling, please see [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org), [stringi](https://stringi.gagolewski.com/),
[rex](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rex), and
[rematch2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rematch2)

## Installation

You can install the development version of regexcite from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("nightwatch-analytics/regexcite")
```
Although, I wouldn't recommend it...
